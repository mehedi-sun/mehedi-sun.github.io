Hello, I'm Md Mehedi Hasan Sun, But you can call me **Mehedi** (Meh-he-dee). I am a PhD candidate in the [Department of Computer Science](https://www.wm.edu/as/computerscience/) at [William & Mary](https://www.wm.edu/), where I am fortunate to be advised by [Dr. Oscar Chaparro](https://ojcchar.github.io/). My research interest lies in Software engineering, broadly applying machine learning/ deep learning techniques to assist developers in software engineering tasks

Before this, I was a Software Engineer at [Kona Software Lab](https://www.konasl.com/) in Dhaka which is a Bangladesh based payments and security solutions company. I was working on a banking application called [NexusPay](www.dutchbanglabank.com/nexuspay/nexusPay-home.html) which has a 3.5 million active users. I completed my BSSE (Bachelor of Science in Software Engineering) degree from [Institute of Information Technology(IIT)](http://www.iit.du.ac.bd/) of [University of Dhaka](https://www.du.ac.bd/). As an undergraduate student, I worked as intern at [Secure Link Services Ltd](https://selisegroup.com/) as a frontend developer.
