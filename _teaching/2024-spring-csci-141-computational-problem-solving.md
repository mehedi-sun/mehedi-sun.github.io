As a Teaching Assistant and Lab Assistant of [CSCI 141: Computational Problem Solving](), my role was grading assignments and projects, providing constructive feedback, and maintaining accurate grade records. I conducted labs where I helped students gain hands on experience on theories taught in classes. I held office time to assist students in clarifying lab requirements, completing unfinished tasks, explaining assignments, addressing grade disputes.
